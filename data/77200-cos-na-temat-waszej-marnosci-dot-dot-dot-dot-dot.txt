I AM SO ALL-AMERICAN, I'D SELL YOU SUICIDE 
I AM TOTALITARIAN, I'VE GOT ABORTIONS IN MY EYES 
I HATE THE HATER, I'D RAPE THE RAPER 
I AM THE ANIMAL WHO WILL NOT BE HIMSELF 
FUCK IT 
HEY VICTIM, SHOULD I BLACK YOUR EYES AGAIN? 
HEY VICTIM, 
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO PUT THE STICK IN MY HAND 
I AM THE ISM, MY HATE'S A PRISM 
LET'S JUST KILL EVERYONE AND LET YOUR GOD SORT THEM OUT 
FUCK IT 
EVERYBODY'S SOMEONE ELSE'S NIGGER/I KNOW YOU ARE SO AM I
I WASN'T BORN WITH ENOUGH MIDDLE FINGERS/ 
I DON'T NEED TO CHOOSE A SIDE 
I BETTER, BETTER, BETTER, BETTER NOT SAY THIS 
BETTER, BETTER, BETTER, BETTER NOT TELL 
I HATE THE HATER, I'D RAPE THE RAPER 
I AM THE IDIOT WHO WILL NOT BE HIMSELF 
FUCK IT 

I DON'T WANT YOU AND I DON'T NEED YOU 
DON'T BOTHER TO RESIST, I'LL BEAT YOU 
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS WRONG 
THE WEAK ONES ARE THERE TO JUSTIFY THE STRONG 
THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, 
IT'S ALL RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF YOUR STEEPLE 
YOU CAN'T SEE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES, 
AND YOU CAN'T SMELL 
YOUR OWN SHIT ON YOUR KNEES 
HEY YOU, WHAT DO YOU SEE? 
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL, SOMETHING FREE? 
HEY YOU, ARE YOU TRYING TO BE MEAN? 
IF YOU LIVE WITH APES, MAN, IT'S HARD TO BE CLEAN 
THERE'S NO TIME TO DISCRIMINATE, 
HATE EVERY MOTHERFUCKER 
THAT'S IN YOUR WAY 
THE WORMS WILL LIVE IN EVERY HOST 
IT'S HARD TO PICK WHICH ONE THEY EAT MOST 
THE HORRIBLE PEOPLE, THE HORRIBLE PEOPLE 
IT'S AS ANATOMIC AS THE SIZE OF YOUR STEEPLE 
CAPITALISM HAS MADE IT THIS WAY, 
OLD-FASHIONED FASCISM 
WILL TAKE IT AWAY 

YOU CUT OFF ALL OF YOUR FINGERS 
TRADE THEM IN FOR DOLLAR BILLS 
CAKE ON SOME MORE MAKE-UP TO 
COVER ALL THOSE LINES 
WAKE UP AND STOP SHAKING 
CAUSE YOU'RE JUST WASTING TIME 
DON'T YOU WANT SOME OF THIS? 
DON'T YOU NEED SOME OF THIS? 
YOU TAKE BUT CANNOT BE GIVEN 
YOU RIDE BUT CANNOT BE RIDDEN
PINCH THIS TINY HEART OF MINE
WRAP IT UP IN SOILED TWINE 
YOU NEVER READ WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN 
I'LL BE YOUR LOVER, I'LL BE FOREVER
I'LL BE TOMORROW, I AM ANYTHING WHEN I'M HIGH 
DON'T YOU WANT SOME OF THIS? 
DON'T YOU NEED SOME OF THIS? 
YOU SHOVE YOUR HAIR DOWN MY THROAT 
I FEEL YOUR FINGERS IN ME 
TEAR THIS BITTER FRUIT TO MESS 
AND WRAP IT IN YOUR SOILED DRESS 
NOW YOU MUST SPIT OUT THE SEEDS 
ALL DRIED UP AND TIED UP FOREVER 
ALL FUCKED UP AND DEAD TO THE WORLD... 

SHE'S MADE OF HAIR AND BONE AND LITTLE TEETH 
AND THINGS I CANNOT SPEAK 
SHE COMES ON LIKE A CRIPPLED PLAYTHING 
SPINE IS JUST A STRING 
I WRAPPED OUR LOVE IN ALL THIS FOIL 
SILVER-TIGHT LIKE SPIDER LEGS 
I NEVER WANTED IT TO EVER SPOIL 
BUT FLIES WILL ALWAYS LAY THEIR EGGS 
TAKE YOUR HATRED OUT ON ME 
MAKE YOUR VICTIM MY HEAD 
YOU NEVER EVER BELIEVED IN ME 
I AM YOUR TOURNIQUET 
PROSTHETIC SYNTHESIS WITH BUTTERFLY 
SEALED UP WITH VIRGIN STITCH 
IF IT HURTS JUST TELL ME 
PRESERVE THE INNOCENCE 
I NEVER WANTED IT TO END THIS WAY 
BUT FLIES WILL LAY THEIR EGGS 

THERE'S AN APPLE IN THE PUSSY MOUTH 
NOW I AM THE DINNER WHORE 
THERE'S A TUMOR IN THE T.V. MOUTH 
BURN IT OUT BEFORE IT GROWS 
SOMEONE BETTER GET THE DOG TO KICK, JAWS WIRED SHUT TO 
SAVE THE DICK 
OUT OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT COMES THE LITTLE HORN 
"LITTLE HORN IS BORN" 
THE WORLD SPREADS ITS LEGS FOR ANOTHER STAR 
WORLD SHOWS ITS FACE FOR ANOTHER SCAR 
DEAD WILL DANCE FOR WHAT IS LEFT 
THE WORMS WILL WAIT WITH BAITED BREATH 
"YOUR BLIND HAVE NOW BECOME MY DEAF" 
SO SAYS THE LITTLE HORN 
"SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS..." 
EVERYONE WILL SUFFER NOW...
"YOU CAN'T SAVE YOURSELF..."

EACH TIME I MAKE MY MOTHER CRY AN 
ANGEL DIES AND FALLS FROM HEAVEN 
WHEN THE BOY IS STILL A WORM ITS HARD TO 
LEARN THE NUMBER SEVEN 
BUT WHEN THEY GET TO YOU 
IT'S THE FIRST THING THAT THEY DO 
EACH TIME I LOOK OUTSIDE 
MY MOTHER DIES, I FEEL MY BACK IS CHANGING SHAPE 
WHEN THE WORM CONSUMES THE BOY IT'S NEVER 
CONSIDERED RAPE 
WHEN THEY GET TO YOU 
PRICK YOUR FINGER IT IS DONE... 
THE MOON HAS NOW ECLIPSED THE SUN... 
THE ANGEL HAS SPREAD HIS WINGS... 
THE TIME HAS COME FOR BITTER THINGS...

WHEN YOU WISH UPON YOUR STAR 
DON'T LET YOURSELF FALL, FALL IN TOO HARD 
I FELL INTO YOU AND I'M ON MY BACK 
AN INSECT DECAYING IN YOUR LITTLE TRAP 
I SQUIRM INTO YOU, NOW I'M IN YOUR GUT 
I FELL INTO YOU, NOW I'M IN A RUT 
"I LIFT YOU UP LIKE THE SWEETEST ANGEL, I'LL 
TEAR YOU DOWN LIKE A WHORE. I WILL BURY YOUR 
GOD IN MY WARM SPIT, YOU'LL BE DEFORMED IN 
YOUR PORN" 
ROCK STAR YEAH (YOU'RE SUCH A DIRTY, DIRTY) 
ROCK STAR YEAH (DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY) 
YOU EAT UP MY HEART AND ALL THE LITTLE PARTS 
YOUR STAR IS SO SHARP 
IT LEAVES ME JAGGED HOLES 
I MAKE MYSELF SICK JUST TO POISON YOU 
IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU THEN NO ONE WILL 
YOU ARE THE ONE I WANT AND WHAT I WANT IS SO UNREAL 
I'M SUCH A DIRTY ROCK STAR YEAH... 
(I AM THE ONE YOU WANT AND WHAT YOU WANT IS SO UNREAL)

WHEN WILL REALIZE YOU'RE ALREADY THERE? 
SO WATERED DOWN-YOUR FEELINGS HAVE TURNED TO MUD. 
"LOVE EVERYBODY" IS DESTROYING THE VALUE OF 
ALL HATE HAS GOT ME NOWHERE 
I KNOW I'M SLIPPING, I KNOW I'M SLIPPING, I KNOW I'M SLIPPING AWAY 
OH NO, IT IS EVERYTHING THEY SAID IT WAS 
OH NO, I AM EVERYTHING THEY SAID I WAS 
WHEN YOU YOU GET TO HEAVEN YOU WILL WISH YOU YOU'RE IN HELL 
WHEN WILL YOU REALIZE, YOU'RE ALREADY HERE 
YOU'LL THANK US NOW THAT YOU HAVE CROSSED OVER 
DON'T PICK THE SCABS OR YOU WILL NEVER HEAL 
THE WORLD SHUDDERS AS THE WORM GETS HIS WINGS 
THEN I GOT MY WINGS AND I NEVER EVEN KNEW IT 
WHEN I WAS A WORM, THOUGHT I WOULDN'T GET THROUGH IT...

HEY. MR. SUPERSTAR: 
"I'LL DO ANYHTING FOR YOU" 
"I'M YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN"

SUPERSTAR, SUPERFUCK BABY...

HE IS THE ANGEL WITH THE SCABBED WINGS 
HARD-DRUG FACE, WANT TO POWDER HIS NOSE
HE WILL DEFLOWER THE FRESHEST CROP 
DRY UP ALL THE WOMBS WITH HIS ROCK AND ROLL SORES 
DEAD 
IS WHAT HE IS, HE DOES WHAT HE PLEASE 
THE THINGS THAT HE HAS YOU'LL NEVER WANT TO SEE 
WHAT YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE NOW 
SKETCH A LITTLE KEYHOLE FOR LOOKING-GLASS PEOPLE 
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HIM 
YOU ONLY WANT TO SEE HIM 
MOMMY'S GOT A SCARECROW, GOTTA LET THE CORN GROW 
MAN CAN'T ALWAYS REAP WHAT HE SOW 
"HE IS THE MAKER" 
(HE IS THE TAKER) 
"HE IS THE SAVIOUR" 
(HE IS THE RAPER) 
GET BACK YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LEAVE HIM 
GET BACK YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA PLEASE HIM

HE LIVES INSIDE MY MOUTH 
AND TELLS ME WHAT TO SAY 
WHEN HE TURNS THE TRAINS 
ON HE MAKES IT GO AWAY 
THE HANDS ARE CRACKED AND DIRTY AND 
THE NAILS ARE BEETLE WINGS 
WHEN HE TURNS THE TRAINS ON HE 
UNTIES ALL OF THE STRINGS 
     THE WORM: "TELL ME SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL, 
          TELL ME SOMETHING FREE, 
          TELL ME SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL 
          AND I WISH THAT I COULD BE." 
(THEN I GOT MY WINGS AND I NEVER EVEN KNEW IT, 
WHEN I WAS A WORM, THOUGHT I COULDN'T GET THROUGH IT) 
     JACK: (NOT SPOKEN) COME, COME 
THE TOYS ALL SMELL LIKE CHILDREN 
AND SCAB-KNEES WILL OBEY 
I'LL HAVE TO KNEEL ON BROOMSTICKS
JUST TO MAKE IT GO AWAY 
     [THE INAUGURATION OF THE WORM] 
(THEN I GOT MY WINGS AND I NEVER EVEN KNEW IT, 
WHEN I WAS A WORM, THOUGHT I COULDN'T GET THROUGH IT) 
A VOICE WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD: "BECAUSE TODAY 
IS BLACK/BECAUSE THERE IS NO TURNING BACK. 
BECAUSE YOUR LIES HAVE WATERED ME/ I HAVE BECOME THE 
STRONGEST WEED" WEED... 
     THROUGH JACK'S EYES: 
THE TASTE OF METAL 
DISINTEGRATOR 
          THREE HOLES UPON THE LEATHER BELT 
          IT'S CUT AND SWOLLEN 
          AND THE AGE IS SHOWING 
BOY: " THERE'S NO ONE HERE TO SAVE OURSELF." 
THE DISINTEGRATOR: (TO HIMSELF) 
THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD FEAR 
YOU ARE WHAT YOU SHOULD FEAR


YOU BUILT ME UP WITH YOUR WISHING HELL 
I DIDN'T HAVE TO SELL YOU 
YOU THREW YOUR MONEY IN THE PISSING WELL
YOU DO JUST WHAT THEY TELL YOU 
REPENT, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
I SHED THE SKIN TO FEED THE FAKE

WHOSE MISTAKE AM I ANYWAY?

WE'RE T.V. 
SPREAD ME OPEN, STICKING TO MY POINTY RIBS ARE
ALL YOUR INFANTS IN ABORTION CRIBS

Go ahead (somethingerother) and date a dead messiah 
We can dig another grave. 
This is your calling 
If you are hearing this, there is nothing I can do 
Something has grown out of my chest. 
I have seen it. 
It is hard and cold.
It has been dormant for many years. 
We are trying to save you, I have come to save you 
This is what you deserve, 
this is what we deserve 
This is something we have brought upon ourselves. 
We are not a victim, you are not a victim 
we are not a victim, you are not a victim 
God will grovel before me 
God will crawl at my feet. 
And the time is this 
And the time is... 
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you...
