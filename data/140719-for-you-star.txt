        ... I could take You up, so high...
In the blue sky we can fly!
At the Sunrise we would greet the Gods -
At the Sunset - loose our thirsty hearts!
We shall ride on the hottest winds -
Yeah... Let's fly on the devilish wings!
Oh... my Beauty, my Pure Goddess!
Come! Let's join our desired bodies!
