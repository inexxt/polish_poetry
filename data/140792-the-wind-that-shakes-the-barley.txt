 




 


 


There’s music in my heart all day,


 


I hear late and early,


 


It comes from fields are far away,


 


The wind that shakes the barley.
  


 


 


 


Above the uplands drenched with dew


 


The sky hangs soft and pearly,


 


An emerald world is listening to


 


The wind that shakes the barley.


 


 


 


Above the bluest mountain crest


 


The lark is singing rarely,


 


It rocks the singer into rest,


 


The wind that shakes the barley. 


 


 


 


Oh, still through summers and through springs


 


It call me late and early.


 


Come home, come home, come home, it sings,


 


The wind that shakes the barley.
