Green eyes, ocean-deep
Did you fall asleep?
Black hair, wet with tears
Surmount all my fears
Lips, like strawberries red
Now seem pale, cold and dead
Skin, as white as the snow
How I wish you could know
It's the last time when we meet
Your heart is dead, candles lit
The black hair. Gone. Tell me, where?
In the grave. Buried, down there.
Crows are sobbing on the pinetree
Clouds are gathering, rain breaks free
